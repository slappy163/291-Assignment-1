    The ER model looks amazing, we have some similar features thus I assume we agree on the relationships. I thought your comment was a bit harsh, and you should have a more professional relationship with your group members such as showering before coming to our meetings. From: dthai

    The two relationships "retweet" and "follow" are connected. Relationships should be between two entities. From: ceddie1

    The diagram is well organized. I noticed both of the attributes "short text" and "long text" are underlined, I think the entity "URL" should only have one unique attribute. From: ceddie1

    I think there should be a participation constraint between the entity "tweet" and the relationship "write". Otherwise, the constraints look good. From: ceddie1
