Christian Eddie's comments:
    Daniel Thai - The two relationships "retweet" and "follow" are connected. Relationships should be between two entities.

    Brandon Misunis - I think there should be a participation constraint between the entity "tweet" and the relationship "write".

    Lei Xiao (George) - Both of the attributes "short text" and "long text" are underlined. I think the entity "URL" should only have one unique attribute.
